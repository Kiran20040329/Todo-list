### Hierarchical Clustering Techniques

Hierarchical clustering is an **unsupervised learning method** used to group data into a hierarchy of clusters. It creates a tree-like structure called a **dendrogram**, which represents how data points are grouped together based on their similarity. 

Hierarchical clustering is categorized into two approaches: **Agglomerative (Bottom-Up)** and **Divisive (Top-Down)**.

### 1. **Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (AHC)**
   - **Concept**: Starts with each data point as a single cluster and repeatedly merges the closest clusters until all points belong to a single cluster.
   - **Steps**:
     1. Treat each data point as an individual cluster.
     2. Calculate the distance (or similarity) between all clusters.
     3. Merge the two clusters that are the closest.
     4. Update the distance matrix to reflect the new cluster.
     5. Repeat until a single cluster containing all data points is formed.

### 2. **Divisive Hierarchical Clustering (DHC)**
   - **Concept**: Starts with a single cluster containing all data points and repeatedly splits it into smaller clusters until each data point forms its own cluster.
   - **Steps**:
     1. Treat all data points as one cluster.
     2. Split the cluster into two smaller clusters based on differences or dissimilarities.
     3. Continue splitting until each cluster contains a single data point.

### **Distance Metrics**
To measure the similarity or distance between clusters, various metrics are used:
1. **Euclidean Distance**: Measures straight-line distance between two points.
2. **Manhattan Distance**: Measures distance along axes at right angles.
3. **Cosine Similarity**: Measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors.

### **Linkage Criteria**
When clustering, the way distances between clusters are measured depends on the linkage criterion used:
1. **Single Linkage**: The distance between the closest pair of data points in two clusters.
2. **Complete Linkage**: The distance between the farthest pair of data points in two clusters.
3. **Average Linkage**: The average distance between all points in one cluster to all points in another.
4. **Centroid Linkage**: The distance between the centroids (mean points) of two clusters.

### **Advantages of Hierarchical Clustering**
- Does not require the number of clusters to be specified in advance.
- Produces a dendrogram, allowing flexibility in selecting the number of clusters.
- Useful for small to medium-sized datasets.

### **Disadvantages of Hierarchical Clustering**
- Computationally expensive for large datasets since distances need to be computed multiple times.
- Sensitive to noise and outliers, which can distort clustering results.
- Results may be hard to interpret for large datasets.

### **Example Application**:
Imagine grouping customers based on their purchase behavior in a store:
- **Agglomerative**: Start by treating each customer as its own cluster, then gradually merge similar customers based on their shopping patterns.
- **Divisive**: Begin with one big group of all customers and repeatedly split it based on dissimilar shopping behaviors.
