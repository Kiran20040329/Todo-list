The **Apriori algorithm** is used in **association rule learning** to identify frequent itemsets and generate rules in transactional datasets. It works by:

1. **Input**: Starts with a transactional dataset where each row represents a transaction and columns represent items.
2. **Support**: Measures the frequency of itemsets in the dataset.
3. **Frequent Itemsets**: Iteratively finds frequent itemsets by pruning those below a predefined support threshold.
4. **Generate Rules**: Creates "if-then" rules from frequent itemsets based on confidence (the likelihood of one item occurring given another is present).

**Example**: In a grocery dataset:
- Rule: "If {Milk}, then {Bread}" with 75% confidence.
This indicates that customers buying Milk also tend to buy Bread 75% of the time.

The Apriori algorithm is widely used in market basket analysis, healthcare, and website behavior analysis. Let me know if youâ€™d like further clarification or an example implementation! ðŸ˜Š
