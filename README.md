### What is Clustering?

Clustering is an **unsupervised learning technique** that involves grouping data points into clusters such that:
- Data points within the same cluster are more similar to each other.
- Data points in different clusters are significantly different.

Clustering is commonly used in applications like customer segmentation, image compression, anomaly detection, and market analysis.

### Partition-Based Clustering Techniques

Partition-based clustering divides the dataset into non-overlapping subsets (or partitions). Each data point belongs to exactly one cluster, and the algorithm aims to optimize a specific criterion, such as minimizing the distance between points in a cluster. Two well-known techniques are:

#### 1. **K-Means Clustering**:
   - **Concept**: K-Means is an iterative algorithm that partitions the dataset into **K clusters** based on similarity.
   - **Steps**:
     1. Randomly initialize the centroids of the K clusters.
     2. Assign each data point to the cluster with the closest centroid.
     3. Update the cluster centroids by calculating the mean of all points in the cluster.
     4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until centroids stabilize or a predefined criterion is met.
   - **Use Case**: Customer segmentation, market basket analysis.

#### 2. **K-Medoids Clustering (PAM - Partitioning Around Medoids)**:
   - **Concept**: Similar to K-Means, but instead of using the mean, it selects **actual data points (medoids)** as cluster centers.
   - **Steps**:
     1. Initialize K medoids randomly.
     2. Assign each data point to the cluster of the closest medoid.
     3. Swap medoids with other points in the cluster to minimize overall distance.
     4. Iterate until no further swaps improve the solution.
   - **Advantage**: More robust to outliers than K-Means since medoids are less sensitive to extreme values.
   - **Use Case**: Healthcare data grouping or fraud detection.

### Key Differences Between K-Means and K-Medoids:
| **Aspect**      | **K-Means**                            | **K-Medoids**                          |
|------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Cluster Center   | Centroid (mean of points).             | Medoid (actual data point).             |
| Sensitivity      | Sensitive to outliers.                | Robust against outliers.                |
| Computation      | Faster and computationally efficient. | Slower but more accurate in noisy data. |
